{"name":"The Adventures of DJ Khaled ","tagline":"","body":"###The Adventures of DJ Khaled\r\nSo I recently attended a programming event called \"CodeDay\" hosted in Seattle and this was the game that I made. It's a very simple and silly game. If time permits, I might make some bug fixes and add some more features such as:\r\n\r\n-Different difficulties\r\n\r\n-Hit points for minions\r\n\r\n-Jet Ski stage\r\n\r\n-Cocoa Butter\r\n\r\nand etc.\r\n\r\nHere's the link: \r\n\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107306189/DJKHALED/index.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy! :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
